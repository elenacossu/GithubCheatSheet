1. before starting
    
    `which git` → in terminal to know where git is
    
2. in short if you already have a repository
    
    `git pull origin` → pull everything from main
    
    `git status` → check uncommitted changes
    
    `git add .` → stage everything
    
    `git commit -m “message”` → commit with a message
    
    `git push origin main` → push everything to main
    
3. create a repository: first create your project in R, then
    1. usethis package
        
        `library(usethis)`
        
        `usethis::use_git()`
        
        `usethis::use_github()`
        
4. to create a branch in your repository
    1.  Usethis package: `usethis::pr_init(branch = “branchname”)`
    2. Manually: Create a repository from github project itself (repository name → main → create branch)
    3. Terminal: `git checkout -b nameofnewbranch` (always click refresh)
5. in case of branches
    
    `git branch -a` → see what are your branches
    
    `git checkout -b nameofthebranch` → create branch
    
    `git branch -d nameofthebranch` → delete branch
    
    `git push origin nameofthebranch` → push the branch to the repository
    
    `git merge nameofthebranch` → merge the branch to the repository
    
    `git checkout nameofthebranch` → switch to a branch and committ happily
    
    `git checkout anotherbranchnameormain` → change to another branch
    
6. to push and commit new files to the remote repository: first create your files locally, then:
    1. Manually & terminal
        
        click git sheet in environment Rstudio window
        
        click commit, select which ones you want to commit under staged, then click create commit message, click commit, click close, then click push
        
    2. Terminal option 2
        
        `git status` → to see the untracked file or any change. red means unstaged changes.
        
        `git add .` → to stage everything OR
        
        `git add nameofthescript.R` → to stage that specific script (it’s the same as ticking the box)
        
        `git status` → again to see the changes that are going to be committed
        
        `git commit -m “message”` → to commit with a message
        
        `git status` → again to check everything was properly committed (the difference between committing and staging is that committing creates timestamps in the commit page that can be tracked back)
        
        `git push origin main` OR `git push origin nameofthebranch` → to push everything to the remote origin
        
7. how to get stuff from your own github repository
    1. manually option 1: click pull in the Git environment window in Rstudio
    2. terminal option 2: `git pull origin nameofthebranchORmain`
    3. terminal option 3: `git pull --all` → to pull everything, branches included. it makes a message in case it overrides everything
8. move from master to branch and vice versa
    1. change it manually on github repository page OR
    2. change it manually on main in Git window OR
    3. in terminal: `git checkout nameofthebranchORmain`
9. when you are done and you want to merge remotely
    1. on github
        
        compare & pull button on github
        
        you check from wihch to which you want to merge
        
        click merge pull request
        
        delete branch
        
    2. on terminal
        
        `git branch -a` → to see all branches and what is remote and what is local and to fix the disconnect between the local and the remote information 
        
        `git pull origin main` → to pull the remote stuff to the computer and to update the whole project to reflect what is on remote repository 
        
10. clone a public repository
    
    go to public repository github page and click code → clone → HTPPS link
    
    in terminal `git clone https://github.com/username/repositoryname`
    
11. remove just one file from main: move from main, remove file locally, stage, commit, push
12. removing repository: on github from repository setting
13. making repository private: on github from repository setting
